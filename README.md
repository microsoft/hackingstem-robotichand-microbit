# Introduction
Micropython code for Microsoft Hacking STEM Sensorized Glove and Robotic Hand projects and the Machines That Emulate Humans lesson plan adapted for micro:bit

# Getting Started
1. Download lesson assets at http://aka.ms/hackingSTEM
1. Build your Sensorized Glove and Robotic Hand!
1. Use [Mu](https://codewith.mu/) to flash glove.py to your glove [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) microcontroller
1. Use [Mu](https://codewith.mu/) to flash robotic_hand.py to your hand [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) microcontroller
1. Verify data interactions in Excel from (hand microcontroller)
1. Ready, Set, Science!
